		<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION</h1>
		<hr>

		<h4>Do I need to register on your site to book tickets?</h4>
		<p>No. You can use our service fully without the need to register.
			You just need to provide your details at the time of booking.</p>
		<h4>What if the car doesn't show up?</h4>
		<p>In case the vehicle you booked doesn't show up, we will offer
			you a full refund immediately.</p>
		<h4>What if the car shows up late?</h4>
		<p>We try our best to ensure our partners reach our customers on
			time. But in case of delays, do call us and we will help you out by
			either providing an alternate vehicle or giving you a full refund.</p>
		<h4>What is XXX's peak time charge?</h4>
		<p>XXX peak time charge is a fare-rationalizing rule of using a
			multiplier X or a flat surcharge to the standard fares causing the
			fare to be higher than the standard fare during certain times the
			day; i.e. if X is 1.2 during some point of time then the standard
			fare will be multiplied by 1.2 to get the final fare.</p>
		<h4>Why is there a need to apply a surcharge to my standard fare?</h4>
		<p>
			XXX being a marketplace doesn't control the number of vehicles online
			on its system/platform; verified drivers & operators are independent
			& work as per their convenience. During a normal day when demand &
			supply are met, there is no need to put an extra effort to pull the
			supply side of vehicles. <br> <br>XXX has observed that
			during certain times of the day, when more traffic is on road,
			routine drivers tend to log out of the system to suit their
			convenience as there is no incentive for them to put an extra effort.
			Similarly, when demand suddenly increases, not enough drivers might
			be available on the road. Customers might be inconvenienced by not
			being able to find cabs during such times.<br> <br> As a
			system/solutions provider XXX has limited options to motivate the
			drivers and cater to the high demand timings & scenarios. XXX has
			observed that the drivers are very sensitive to little extra earnings
			for their extra effort to stay logged in to our system. XXX applies
			an X multiplier or flat surcharge to the normal fare based on various
			situations and scenarios like place of pickup, time of pickup, type
			of vehicle, demand situation, supply scenario etc. Using advanced
			analytics, unique algorithm, past ride experiences etc. the XXX
			software calculates an appropriate surcharge to apply over and above
			the normal fare. This enables XXX to come up with appropriate
			incentives to drivers to make them stay logged in to the system for
			the additional earnings. This enables customers to get their much
			needed service even during peak times when demand for cabs is high.<br>
			<br>The peak time surcharge works in two ways<br> <br>
			<span>[1]It motivates drivers to stay & serve for a longer
				time even during difficult hours of the day and when demand is high.<br>
				<br>[2] It filters out the less needed rides hence making the
				vehicle available to those who really need a cab.

		<h4>Can I use another person's credit card for payment of my car
			rental?</h4>
		<p>Credit cards must be in the hirer's name that should be
			embossed on the front of the card. The signature of the card holder
			must appear on the reverse.</p>
		<h4>Can I use my company credit card for my car rental?</h4>
		<p>A company credit card with the name and signature of the card
			holder on the front and the back is acceptable for paying the car
			rental. Makemytrip.com provides cheap and affordable car hire
			services in india.</p>
		<h4>Can I reserve a specific make/model of car?</h4>
		<p>While we note your preference when you reserve a car, it is
			sometimes difficult to guarantee a particular model. If you do not
			get your preferred choice, you will receive a car similar in size and
			within the same car group classification.</p>
